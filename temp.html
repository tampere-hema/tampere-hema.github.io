You will be taught the basics of Armizare, the art of armed combat according to 15th century Italian fencing master Fiore dei Liberi. It is a broad system that includes longsword, wrestling, dagger, spears and pole-axes, as well as fencing on horseback.

            <h2>BEGINNER COURSES START ON TUESDAY 2.9.2025 - FULL</h2>

            This year we are organizing two beginner courses at once:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Fiore dei Liberi's Longsword and dagger</b></li>
              <li><b>Joachim Meyer's rappier</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Paying the beginner course fee entitles you to attend both classes
              and continue training for the rest of the autumn trimester.
            </p>
            <p>
              Armizare is the art of armed combat according to 15th century
              Italian fencing master Fiore dei Liberi. It's a broad system that
              includes longsword, wrestling, dagger, spears and pole-axes, as
              well as fencing on horseback. The beginners course will focus on
              the basics of the hand-and-a-half longsword and the rondel dagger.
            </p>
            <p>
              Joachim Meyer was a cutler and fencing master of the Liechtenauer
              tradition, who lived in the latter half of the 16th century. His
              treatises similarly cover a variety of weapons. Rappier is a
              relatively light single-handed cut and thrust sword, used with a
              combination of both German and Italian techniques. The beginner's
              course provides an introduction to the primary principles of
              Meyer's rappier fencing, both with the sword alone and paired with
              an off-hand dagger.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to bring your own sword for either course, longsword
              feders are preferred for Armizare. For Meyer, basically any
              single-handed sword works but traditional arming swords with
              simple crossguards and sideswords are preferred. The club has
              loaner swords for both courses, so unless you already own a sword,
              there is no need to rush into purchasing one.
